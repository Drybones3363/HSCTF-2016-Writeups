According to the hint, we could easily tell it's a word search. The size of the text is 49 characters by 49 characters.

I did some heavy searches of words within the word search and found no luck. I then realized it could be ciphered, so i decided to bruteforce a caesar cipher and kept looking for the word flag. I found out a Rot-8 decryption would solve that problem and I found "THEFLAGISCALLED" within the word search. Well, there wasn't anything after "THEFLAGISCALLED" so I got stuck once again. I then found out there were a lot of clues to what the flag was within the word search (as shown in Word Search.png). "FISONEWORD,FISNOTANYPENGUIN,FISWHITEBLACK,FISREADALLOVER"

So from these hints, I found out the flag to be newspaper.

<i> Flag:</i><b> newspaper</b>
